1. Study design
---------------

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details."

3. Instruction list
-------------------

#1 - Download the data
Download the data using the following link (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

#2 - Unzip the file

#3 - Place the extracted folder in the folder you wish to work in (note the filepath, you will need it in step 4)

#4 - Open R and ensure your working directory is set to the folder you placed the data folders in (in step #3).
Use the getwd() command in R in order to see which is your current working directory in R. Use the setwd() command in order to change your working directory to the folder you placed the data in.

#5 - Run the run_analysis.R script in R.

#6 - A tidy dataset named tidy_data.txt will be created in your working directory folder.
